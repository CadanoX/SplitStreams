      this family exist, most of which bind specifically to regulatory
      subunits of CYCLIC-AMP-DEPENDENT PROTEIN KINASE TYPE II such as CAMP
      PROTEIN KINASE RIIALPHA or CAMP PROTEIN KINASE RIIBETA.

MS  - A parameter usually used in PRENATAL ULTRASONOGRAPHY to measure the
      length of the uterine neck (CERVIX UTERI). Cervical length or its
      shortening is used to identify and prevent early cervical opening and
      PRETERM BIRTH.

MS  - Disorders comprising a spectrum of brain malformations representing
      the paradigm of a diffuse neuronal migration disorder. They result in

      of two genes,  LIS1, the gene for the non-catalytic subunit of
      PLATELET-ACTIVATING FACTOR ACETYLHYDROLASE IB; and DCX or XLIS, the
      gene for doublecortin, have been identified as the most common causes
      of disorders in this spectrum. Additional variants of classical (Type

MS  - Lasers with a semiconductor diode as the active medium. Diode lasers
      transform electric energy to light using the same principle as a
      light-emitting diode (LED), but with internal reflection capability,
      thus forming a resonator where a stimulated light can reflect back and
      forth, allowing only a certain wavelength to be emitted. The emission
      of a given device is determined by the active compound used (e.g.,
      gallium arsenide crystals doped with aluminum or indium). Typical
      wavelengths are 810, 1,060 and 1,300 nm. (From UMDNS, 2005)

MS  - A subtype of non-receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase that is
      closely-related to PROTEIN TYROSINE PHOSPHATASE, NON-RECEPTOR TYPE 1.
      Alternative splicing of the mRNA for this phosphatase results in the
      production at two gene products, one of which includes a C-terminal
      nuclear localization domain that may be involved in the transport of
      the protein to the CELL NUCLEUS. Although initially referred to as
      T-cell protein tyrosine phosphatase the expression of this subtype
      occurs widely.
