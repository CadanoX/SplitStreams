      Use of Laboratory Animals introduced the policy that institutions
      using warm-blooded animals in projects supported by NIH grants either
      be accredited by a recognized professional laboratory animal
      accrediting body or establish its own committee to evaluate animal
      care; the Public Health Service adopted a policy in 1979 requiring
      such committees; and the 1985 amendments to the Animal Welfare Act
      mandate review and approval of federally funded research with animals
      by a formally designated Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee

      which aborts during development so the fruit (a dry, winged structure)
      contains only one seed. The latex is a source of RUBBER.  Tochu tea is

      will not cause an epidemic. Also, in such immunized populations,
      susceptible individuals are not likely to become infected.  Herd
      immunity can also refer to the case when unprotected individuals fail

MS  - One of the largest orders of mostly marine CRUSTACEA, containing over
      10,000 species. Like AMPHIPODA, the other large order in the
      superorder Peracarida, members are shrimp-like in appearance, have
      sessile compound eyes, and no carapace. But unlike Amphipoda, they
      possess abdominal pleopods (modified as gills) and their bodies are
      dorsoventrally flattened.

      FIBERS, MYELINATED) which is 1:1. Usually several axons are surrounded
      by a single Schwann cell in the unmyelinated nerve fibers. Therefore,
      each unmyelinated fiber is not completely covered by the MYELIN SHEATH
      formed by the Schwann cell. Unmyelinated nerve fibers conduct impulses

      gene result in L1 disease. Neural cell adhesion molecule L1 is

MS  - Dimeric cell surface receptor involved in angiogenesis
      (NEOVASCULARIZATION, PHYSIOLOGICAL) and axonal guidance.  Neuropilin-1
      is a 140 kD tramsmembrane protein that binds CLASS 3 SEMAPHORINS, and
      several other growth factors.  Neuropilin-1 forms complexes with
      plexins or VEGF RECEPTORS, and binding affinity and specificity are
      determined by the composition of the neuropilin dimer and the identity
      of other receptors complexed with it. Neuropilin-1 is expressed in
      distinct patterns during neural development, complementary to those
      described for NEUROPILIN-2.

MS  - Transmembrane receptor for CLASS 3 SEMAPHORINS and several vascular
      endothelial growth factor isoforms.  Neuropilin-2 functions either as
      a homodimer or as a heterodimer with NEUROPILIN-1. The binding
      affinity of neuropilin-2 varies for different class 3 semaphorin
      isoforms and is dependent on the composition of the dimer.  The
      protein also forms receptor complexes with plexins and with VEGF
      RECEPTORS, which alters the binding characteristics of the receptor.

UI  - D039921

MS  - Neuropilins are 140 kD vertebrate cell surface receptors that bind
      neuronal guidance molecules during neural development and axonal
      outgrowth, and modulate VEGF-mediated angiogenesis.  NEUROPILIN-1 and
      NEUROPILIN-2 differ in their binding specificities, and are
      distributed complementarily in regions of the developing nervous
      system.  Neuropilins are receptors for secreted CLASS 3 SEMAPHORINS as
      well as for vascular endothelial growth factors, and may form hetero-
      or homodimers. They may also interact synergistically with plexins and
      with VEGF RECEPTORS to form receptor complexes with distinct
      affinities and specificities.  Neuropilin binding specificity is
      determined by CUB and coagulation-factor-like domains in the
      extracellular portion of the molecule, while a MAM domain is essential
      for SIGNAL TRANSDUCTION.

      OCULAR) on long exposure to bright light. Photobleaching presents
      problems when occurring in PHOTODYNAMIC THERAPY, and in FLUORESCENCE
      MICROSCOPY. On the other hand, this phenomenon is exploited in the

      N-terminal portion of protein is a potent transcriptional activator,

      to the fact that genetic recombination events result in fusion
      oncogene proteins (ONCOGENE PROTEINS, FUSION) that contain the
      N-terminal region of this protein. These fusion proteins have been

      neurons in the developing nervous system. It has so far been found
      only in vertebrates, and binds to NEUROPILIN-1/plexin complex
      receptors on growth cones.  Like other class 3 semaphorins, it is a
      secreted protein.

MS  - A family of proteins that mediate axonal guidance.  Semaphorins act as
      repulsive cues for neuronal GROWTH CONES and bind to receptors on
      their filopodia. At least 20 different molecules have been described
      and divided into eight classes based on domain organization and
      species of origin.  Classes 1 and 2 are invertebrate, classes 3-7 are
      vertebrate, and class V are viral.  Semaphorins may be secreted
      (classes 2, 3, and V), transmembrane (classes 1, 4, 5, and 6), or
      membrane-anchored (class 7).  All semaphorins possess a common
      500-amino acid extracellular domain which is critical for receptor
      binding and specificity, and is also found in plexins and scatter
      factor receptors.  Their C termini are class-specific and may contain
      additional sequence motifs.
