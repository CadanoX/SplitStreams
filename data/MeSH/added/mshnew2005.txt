      is based on the principle that some of the ELECTRONS passing through
      the specimen will lose energy when they ionize inner shell electrons
      of the atoms in the specimen. The amount of energy loss is dependent
      upon the element. Analysis of the energy loss spectrum (ELECTRON
      ENERGY-LOSS SPECTROSCOPY) reveals the elemental composition of a
      specimen. It is used analytically and quantitatively to determine
      which, how much of, and where specific ELEMENTS are in a sample. For

      strands of a NUCLEIC ACID in nucleoprotein complexes.
