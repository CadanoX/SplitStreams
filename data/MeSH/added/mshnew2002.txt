MS  - Receptors for ACTIVINS are membrane protein kinases belonging to
      the family of PROTEIN-SERINE-THREONINE KINASES, thus also named
      activin receptor-like kinases (ALK's). Activin receptors also bind
      TRANSFORMING GROWTH FACTOR BETA. As those transmembrane receptors
      of the TGF-beta superfamily (RECEPTORS, TRANSFORMING GROWTH FACTOR
      BETA), ALK's consist of two different but related protein kinases,
      Type I and Type II. Activins initiate cellular signal transduction
      by first binding to the type II receptors (ACTIVIN RECEPTORS, TYPE
      II ) which then recruit and phosphorylate the type I receptors
      (ACTIVIN RECEPTORS, TYPE I ) with subsequent activation of the type
      I kinase activity.

MS  - An enzyme that catalyzes the degradation of GLYCOGEN in animals by
      releasing glucose-1-phosphate from the terminal
      alpha-1,4-glycosidic bond. This enzyme exists in two forms: an
      active phosphorylated form ( PHOSPHORYLASE A) and an inactive
      un-phosphorylated form (PHOSPHORYLASE B). Both a and b forms of 
      phosphorylase exist as homodimers. In mammals, the major isozymes
      of glycogen phosphorylase are found in muscle, liver and brain
      tissue.

MS  - The 46,XX gonadal dysgenesis may be sporadic or familial. Familial
      XX gonadal dysgenesis is transmitted as an autosomal recessive
      trait and its locus was mapped to chromosome 2. Mutation in the
      gene for the FSH receptor (RECEPTORS, FSH) was detected.  Sporadic
      XX gonadal dysgenesis is heterogeneous and has been associated with
      trisomy-13 and trisomy-18. These phenotypic females are
      characterized by a normal stature, sexual infantilism, bilateral
      streak gonads, amenorrhea, elevated plasma LH and FSH
      concentration. The syndrome is sometimes called "pure gonadal
      dysgenesis," but this designation may also refer to gonadal
      dysgenesis with a 46,XY karyotype (GONADAL DYSGENESIS, 46,XY).

      and lysosomal degradation of macromolecules such as: LIPOPROTEINS,
      ENDOPEPTIDASES and PROTEASE INHIBITORS.

      to lysine residues of specific proteins within the cell. These
      "ubiquitinated" proteins can be recognized and degraded by
      proteosomes or be transported to specific compartments within the

MH  - Vitamin B 6
UI  - D025101
MN  - D11.786.708.935
MS  - VITAMIN B 6 refers to several PICOLINES (especially PYRIDOXINE;
      PYRIDOXAL; & PYRIDOXAMINE) that are efficiently converted by the
      body to PYRIDOXAL PHOSPHATE which is a coenzyme for synthesis of
      amino acids, neurotransmitters (serotonin, norepinephrine),
      sphingolipids, and aminolevulinic acid.  During transamination of
      amino acids, pyridoxal phosphate is transiently converted into
      PYRIDOXAMINE phosphate. Although pyridoxine and Vitamin B 6 are
      still frequently used as synonyms, especially by medical
      researchers, this practice is erroneous and sometimes misleading
      (EE Snell; Ann NY Acad Sci, vol 585 pg 1, 1990). Most of vitamin B6
      is eventually degraded to PYRIDOXIC ACID and excreted in the urine.

      life-prolonging treatment is usually indexed only with EUTHANASIA,
      PASSIVE, unless the distinction between withholding and withdrawing
      treatment, or the issue of withholding palliative rather than
      curative treatment, is discussed.

      development and function of the urogenital tract.
