MS  - A mass spectrometry technique used for analysis of
      nonvolatile compounds such as proteins and macromolecules.
      The technique involves preparing electrically charged
      droplets from analyte molecules dissolved in solvent. The
      electrically charged droplets enter a vacuum chamber where
      the solvent is evaporated. Evaporation of solvent reduces
      the droplet size, thereby increasing the coulombic repulsion
      within the droplet. As the charged droplets get smaller, the
      excess charge within them causes them to disintegrate and
      release analyte molecules. The volatilized analyte molecules
      are then analyzed by mass spectrometry.
