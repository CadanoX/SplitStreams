      curvature of the long bones especially the TIBIA with dimpling of the
      skin over the bowed areas, malformation of the pelvis and spine, 11
      pairs of ribs, hypoplastic scapulae, club feet, micrognathia, CLEFT
      PALATE, tracheobronchomalacia, and in some patients male-to-female sex
      reversal (SEX REVERSAL, GONADAL). Most patients die in the neonatal
      period of respiratory distress. Campomelic dysplasia is associated
      with haploinsufficiency of the SOX9 gene (SRY-related HMG-box gene 9).
