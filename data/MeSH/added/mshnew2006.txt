MS  - A family of microfilament proteins whose name derives from the fact
      that mutations in members of this protein family have been associated
      with WISKOTT-ALDRICH SYNDROME.  They are involved in ACTIN
      polymerization and contain a polyproline-rich region that binds to
      PROFILIN, and a verprolin homology domain that binds G-ACTIN.

MS  - Wnt proteins are a large family of secreted glycoproteins that play
      essential roles in EMBRYONIC AND FETAL DEVELOPMENT, and tissue
      maintenance. They bind to FRIZZLED RECEPTORS and act as PARACRINE
      PROTEIN FACTORS to initiate a variety of SIGNAL TRANSDUCTION PATHWAYS.
      The canonical Wnt signaling pathway stabilizes the transcriptional
      coactivator BETA CATENIN.
