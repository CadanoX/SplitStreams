MS  - A serotonin receptor subtype that is localized to the CAUDATE NUCLEUS;

      It plays a role as a terminal autoreceptor that regulates the rate of
      SEROTONIN release from nerve endings. This serotonin receptor subtype
      is closely related to and has similar drug binding properties as the
      5-HT1B RECEPTOR, but is expressed at low levels. It is particularly
      sensitive to the agonist SUMATRIPTAN and may be involved in mediating
      the drug's antimigrane effect.

      endothelial growth factor-A was originally isolated from tumor cells
      and referred to as "tumor angiogenesis factor" and "vascular
      permeability factor". Although expressed at high levels in certain
      tumor-derived cells it is produced by a wide variety of cell types. In
      addition to stimulating vascular growth and vascular permeability it
      may play a role in stimulating VASODILATION via NITRIC OXIDE-dependent
      pathways. Alternative splicing of the mRNA for vascular endothelial
      growth factor A results in several isoforms of the protein being
