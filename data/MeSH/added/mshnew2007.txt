MN  - D12.776.70.400.300.249
MN  - D12.776.521.120.300.249
MS  - A 513-kDa protein synthesized in the LIVER. It serves as the major
      structural protein of low-density lipoproteins (LIPOPROTEINS, LDL;
      LIPOPROTEINS, VLDL). It is the ligand for the LDL receptor (RECEPTORS,
      LDL) that promotes cellular binding and internalization of LDL
      particles.

MN  - D12.776.521.120.300.240
MS  - A 241-kDa protein synthesized only in the INTESTINES. It serves as a
      structural protein of CHYLOMICRONS. Its exclusive association with
      chylomicron particles provides an indicator of intestinally derived
      lipoproteins in circulation. Apo B-48 is a shortened form of apo B-100
      and lacks the LDL-receptor region.

MN  - D12.776.70.400.400.500
MN  - D12.776.521.120.400.500
MS  - A 6.6-kDa protein component of VERY-LOW-DENSITY LIPOPROTEINS;
      INTERMEDIATE-DENSITY LIPOPROTEINS; and HIGH-DENSITY LIPOPROTEINS. Apo
      C-I displaces APO E from lipoproteins, modulate their binding to
      receptors (RECEPTORS, LDL), and thereby decrease their clearance from
      plasma. Elevated Apo C-I levels are associated with
      HYPERLIPOPROTEINEMIA and ATHEROSCLEROSIS.
HN  - 2007; use APOLIPOPROTEIN C-I (NM) 1979-2006

MH  - Apolipoprotein C-II
UI  - D053304

MN  - D12.776.70.400.400.750
MN  - D12.776.521.120.400.750
MS  - A 9-kDa protein component of VERY-LOW-DENSITY LIPOPROTEINS. It
      contains a cofactor for LIPOPROTEIN LIPASE and activates several
      triacylglycerol lipases. The association of Apo C-II with plasma
      CHYLOMICRONS; VLDL, and HIGH-DENSITY LIPOPROTEINS is reversible and
      changes rapidly as a function of triglyceride metabolism. Clinically,
      Apo C-II deficiency is similar to lipoprotein lipase deficiency
      (HYPERLIPOPROTEINEMIA TYPE I) and is therefore called
      hyperlipoproteinemia type IB.
HN  - 2007; use APOLIPOPROTEIN C-II (NM) 1978-2006

MN  - D12.776.70.400.400.875

MS  - A 9-kDa protein component of VERY-LOW-DENSITY LIPOPROTEINS and
      CHYLOMICRON REMNANTS. Apo C-III, synthesized in the liver, is an
      inhibitor of LIPOPROTEIN LIPASE. Apo C-III modulates the binding of
      chylomicron remnants and VLDL to receptors (RECEPTORS, LDL) thus
      decreases the uptake of triglyceride-rich particles by the liver cells
      and subsequent degradation. The normal Apo C-III is glycosylated.
      There are several polymorphic forms with varying amounts of SIALIC
      ACID (Apo C-III-0, Apo C-III-1, and Apo C-III-2).

MN  - D12.776.70.400.500.249
MN  - D12.776.521.120.500.249
MS  - One of three major isoforms of apolipoprotein E. In humans, Apo E2
      differs from APOLIPOPROTEIN E3 at one residue 158 where arginine is
      replaced by cysteine (R158--C). In contrast to Apo E3, Apo E2 displays
      extremely low binding affinity for LDL receptors (RECEPTORS, LDL)
      which mediate the internalization and catabolism of lipoprotein
      particles in liver cells. ApoE2 allelic homozygosity is associated
      with HYPERLIPOPROTEINEMIA TYPE III.

MN  - D12.776.521.120.500.500
MS  - A 34-kDa glycosylated protein. A major and most common isoform of
      apolipoprotein E. Therefore, it is also known as apolipoprotein E
      (ApoE). In human, Apo E3 is a 299-amino acid protein with a cysteine
      at the 112 and an arginine at the 158 position. It is involved with
      the transport of TRIGLYCERIDES; PHOSPHOLIPIDS; CHOLESTEROL; and
      CHOLESTERYL ESTERS in and out of the cells.

MN  - D12.776.521.120.500.750
MS  - A major and the second most common isoform of apolipoprotein E. In
      humans, Apo E4 differs from APOLIPOPROTEIN E3 at only one residue 112
      (cysteine is replaced by arginine), and exhibits a lower resistance to
      denaturation and greater propensity to form folded intermediates. Apo
      E4 is a risk factor for ALZHEIMER DISEASE and CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES.

      small hydrophobic ligands including CHOLESTEROL and STEROLS. It occurs
      in the macromolecular complex with LECITHIN CHOLESTEROL
      ACYLTRANSFERASE. Apo D is expressed in and secreted from a variety of
      tissues such as liver, placenta, brain tissue and others.

MS  - A large and highly glycosylated protein constituent of LIPOPROTEIN
      (A). It has very little affinity for lipids but forms
      disulfide-linkage to APOLIPOPROTEIN B100. Apoprotein(a) has SERINE
      PROTEINASE activity and can be of varying sizes from 400- to 800-kDa.
      It is homologous to PLASMINOGEN and is known to modulate THROMBOSIS
      and FIBRINOLYSIS.

MH  - Apoptosomes
UI  - D053478
MN  - D5.500.99
MS  - Multimeric protein complexes formed in the CYTOSOL that play a role in
      the activation of APOPTOSIS. They can occur when MITOCHONDRIA become
      damaged due to cell stress and release CYTOCHROME C. Cytosolic
      cytochrome C associates with APOPTOTIC PROTEASE-ACTIVATING FACTOR 1 to
      form the apoptosomal protein complex. The apoptosome signals apoptosis
      by binding to and activating specific INITIATOR CASPASES such as
      CASPASE 9.

      can be either chemoautotrophs (or chemolithotrophs), largely ARCHAEA
      and BACTERIA, which also use simple inorganic substances for their
      metabolic energy reguirements; or photoautotrophs (or
      photolithotrophs), such as PLANTS and CYANOBACTERIA, which derive

      superfamily that play an essential role in the normal development of
      several ectodermally derived organs. Several isoforms of the
      ectodysplasins exist due to multiple ALTERNATIVE SPLICING of the MRNA
      for the protein. The isoforms ectodysplasin A1 and ectodysplasin A2
      are considered biologically active and each bind distinct
      ECTODYSPLASIN RECEPTORS. Genetic mutations that result in loss of
      function of ectodysplasin result in ECTODERMAL DYSPLASIA 1,
      ANHIDROTIC.

MS  - A highly dense subclass of the high-density lipoproteins, with
      particle sizes below 7 nm. They are also known as nascent HDL,
      composed of a few APOLIPOPROTEIN A-I molecules which are complexed
      with PHOSPHOLIPIDS. The lipid-poor pre-beta-HDL particles serve as
      progenitors of HDL3 and then HDL2 after absorption of free cholesterol
      from cell membranes, cholesterol esterification, and acquisition of
      apolipoproteins A-II, Cs, and E. Pre-beta-HDL initiate the reverse
      cholesterol transport process from cells to liver.

      NEUROTROPHIC FACTOR RECEPTOR. Both membrane-bound and secreted
      isoforms of the receptor subunit exist due to ALTERNATIVE SPLICING of
      its mRNA. The secreted isoform is believed to act as an inhibitory
      receptor, while the membrane-bound form is a signaling receptor.

MS  - A ubiquitously expressed heterodimeric receptor that is specific for
      both INTERFERON-ALPHA and INTERFERON-BETA. It is composed of two
      subunits referred to as IFNAR1 and IFNAR2. The IFNAR2 subunit is
      believed to serve as the ligand-binding chain; however both chains are
      required for signal transduction. The interferon alpha-beta receptor
      signals through the action of JANUS KINASES such as the TYK2 KINASE.
